        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Namrata, originally from Virginia, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity at Arizona State University. Over the past two years, I've developed a strong interest in the field,particularly in discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithms, and information assurance. With an emphasis on cybersecurity, I am aiming to write secure and efficient code and am interested in both front-end and back-end software development. I enjoy working on collaborative projects, learning new technologies and have experience with industry-standard tools and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I was a competitive athlete, and I enjoy playing the guitar, crocheting, making art, and I am an active member of ASU's salsa club.
